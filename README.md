# Game-of-Pig
The Game of Pig redone in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript as a Web App.

### GAME RULES:
  * The game has 2 players, playing in turns
	* Click 'NEW GAME' to begin Playing
	* Before 
    * In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as he 
      whishes. Each result gets added to their TURN score.
    * BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all of their TURN score becomes 0 
      Then it's the next player's turn.
    * IF the Player rolls a DOUBLE (both dice share the same value) their GLOBAL 
      Score is reduced to 0 and it is the next Player's turn.
    * Before rolling, a player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their TURN 
      score gets added to their GLOBAL score. After holding, it is the next player's turn.
    * The first player to reach either the PRE-SET GLOBAL Score of 21 points or the CUSTOM
      GLOBAL Score
